Udacity-Project-Data-Wrangling
This project was completed as part of the Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. This project involved gathering data from varying sources, assessing, cleaning the data, and then finally drawing insights from the data.

The data that was gathered was in reference to the twitter account "WeRateDogs" in which people post pictures of their dogs, rate their dogs, and some users categorize their dogs as either doggo, pupper, puppo and floofer. The data that was gathered came from various sources, including:

Twitter- number of likes and retweets for each original tweet id. I extracted this information from Twitter using json.

csv file provided by Udacity that contained a listing of information including tweet id and rating

csv file provided by Udacity that contained the results of a machine learning algorithm to determine dog breed based on the picture provided in the tweet.

I joined all these data sources together and cleaned and tidied the data. The data wrangling efforts and the insights are presented in the jupyter notebook entitled: "act_report.html".

In order to run this, the following is required:

Installation of python3

Importing the following libraries:

-pandas

-NumPy

-requests

-tweepy

-json

Work was performed in a Jupyter notebook. The link to download the jupyter notebook application can be found here:
